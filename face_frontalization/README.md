Face Frontalization Results on CMU Multi-PIE Face Dataset
</p>



## Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of facial identity preservation during face frontalization, leveraging the capabilities of **StyleGAN**. By generating front-facing views from non-frontal facial images while maintaining accurate identity features, this project is particularly beneficial for facial recognition systems, where frontal images yield optimal performance.

The model was trained using the CMU Multi-PIE Face Dataset, which features paired frontal and non-frontal images. Robust data preparation scripts for the CMU Multi-PIE dataset are included in the project.

---

## Dataset
The **CMU Multi-PIE Face Dataset** was utilized for training, offering:
- Multi-view paired facial images for consistent identity mapping.
- Diverse lighting conditions to enhance the model's generalization capability.

Data preparation scripts for the dataset can be found in the `CMU` folder.

## Model and Training
Key aspects of the model training include:
- Tailored training strategies using paired frontal and profile face images.
- Loss functions optimized for preserving facial identity features.

The pre-trained weights for the model, `frontalization.pt`, are available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10IW2ZFZ8iCkZqTUlTpKhIG8u9SpUeyVk/view?usp=sharing). The processed training data is also accessible [here](https://clemson-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nalipou_clemson_edu/Ec4rubLBddpKoecwLF_q1w8BB-0EdVTEdXvYlbI1k2-mGw?e=VFUg1l).

## Pretrained Models
Please download the pre-trained models from the following links. Each pSp model contains the entire pSp architecture, including the encoder and decoder weights.

| Path | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| [StyleGAN Inversion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bMTNWkh5LArlaWSc_wa8VKyq2V42T2z0/view?usp=sharing) | pSp trained with the FFHQ dataset for StyleGAN inversion. |

The model is taken from the [official implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/moco). |
